# Spooky School (SWEN222 Group Project)

Spooky School is a game that was developed for a SWEN222 Group project. In this game, you play as a student of Spooky School. You and your friends (other players on the server) are trying to retrieve your tests you failed miserably on. You have the night to complete, and get through the puzzles and complete this task.

## Running the game

To play the game, you must first start a server, and then join it. This can be done by running the Main class in the default package. It is recommended you use a moderately powerful computer to run the game (Game works perfectly fine on ECS computers).

1) Run the Main class in the default package.
2) Select “New Server”, and then create the server.
3) Once the server is created, you can use the IP address given in the JTextField to join as a client.
4) To join the server as a client, run the same Main class that was used to run the server, only this time, select “Join Server”. Enter the fields as necessary.
- When running the client on the same machine as the server, the default IP Address of “localhost” will work fine.
- NOTE: When trying to join a server on another machine, the IP address displayed in the JTextField of the “Create Server” window may not be the correct one. However, all possible IP Addresses of the server machine are printed in the JText Field (The text box that shows detailed information about the server).
5) Once you join, you can play the game using the controls outlined below.
